# Junecloud Toolbox
Junecloud Toolbox includes a variety of Automator Actions and a Safari Extension. These tools are designed to take some of the tedium out of your work. Many of them were created specifically for web designers and developers. However, if youâ€™re not either of those, you may still find them useful. [See here for more information](https://junecloud.com/software/mac/junecloud-toolbox.html).
